    ```

## Features and Functionality
<!-- CONCEPT PROCESS -->
## Concept Process
I chose a Western-themed website to create a contrast between selling cold products and the generic idea of a western theme, which usually includes warm climates. It also followes a very limited font and colour scheme to keep visuals consistent across pages and user types. I chose a mixture of light and dark browns to evoke the western theme, however I added red, blue and green to highlight important elements so they do not fade into the background. I worked with lecturers in contact sessions and class to get feedback on imporvements and other implementation ideas.

<!-- Development Process -->
## Development Process

The `Development Process` is the technical implementations and functionality done for the e-commerse store.

<!-- Implementation -->
### Implementation Process

* I used `Axios` to contact `MongoDB`to create the database used in this project, as well as the application `Insomnia` to test the functionality.

<!-- Highlights -->
#### Highlights

* A great highlight was when the Axios calls finally started to work through the Clinet folder (term3). 
* Understanding the process of working through Axios to change data on MongoDB was a great pain until, all at once, it snapped and I knew that I had to do, which was rewarding.
* Revisiting React was also interesting as it has interesting ways to communicate through pages.

<!-- Challenges -->
<!-- Explain the challenges faced with the project and why you think you faced it or how you think you'll solve it (if not solved), or how you solved it -->
#### Challenges

* The largest issue I had was understanding how to properly communicate between the client and server folders. I solved it by following videos supplied to us.

* A lot of repitition had ot be done to account for possible errors that could appear. 

* JSON Web Tokens were also a struggle to understand at first, but I created a personal project to test how it could be done and how it works so i could learn to understand it.

* Axios not updating in time was also a large struggle to overcome, which I did by forcing it to wait at several stages.

<!-- Future Implementation -->
### Future Implementation

* Fixing the image displaying functionality.

* Potential redesigns of the website.

* Potentially adding more than one administrator.

* I would also like to make the website completely responsive.

<!-- VIDEO DEMONSTRATION -->
### Video Demonstration

  * Caution: The video cannot be included in the github repository as the file is larger than 100mb. Therefore, I have included a google drive link.
